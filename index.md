**Welcome**

I write about automation, AI, and business processes from the trenches. Not the hype. Not the theory. The messy reality of making technology deliver actual business value.

This blog is for business leaders evaluating AI projects, IT professionals tired of the hype, and anyone who suspects their company is too complicated to digitize. You'll find skepticism of automation theater, practical lessons from failed transformations, and hard-won insights about making technology work in the real world.

No buzzwords. No evangelism. Just what actually works.
