**Welcome**

From Agile to AI, companies keep making the same mistake: adopting frameworks without understanding the fundamentals. They chase digital transformation, implement GenAI projects, and celebrate ML metrics while missing the only question that matters: Did this actually help the business?

I write about automation, AI, and business processes from the trenches. Not the hype. Not the theory. The messy reality of making technology deliver actual business value.

After years implementing business process automation and watching companies repeat the same mistakes Six Sigma taught us decades ago, I've learned this: The companies that win with AI aren't the ones with the best models. They're the ones who connect technology to real business outcomes and measure what actually matters.

This blog is for business leaders evaluating AI projects, IT professionals tired of the hype, and anyone who suspects their company is too complicated to digitize. You'll find skepticism of automation theater, practical lessons from failed transformations, and hard-won insights about making technology work in the real world.

No buzzwords. No evangelism. Just what actually works.
